// The function logTwice takes a parameter, which is a string. This string is passed to console.log two times. As a result, the string is logged in the console twice.

logHobby()
// "hobby" has a specific meaning that doesn't fit with the context of a variable used for logging. The name "logHobby" more accurately represents the purpose of the variable.
